HOW ITS MADE:

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

In this project ive created a to-do list that you can keep that of chores, goals, or any events you would want to attend. I used HTML to create markup onto the website. I used CSS to position elements in specific areas and add a backround. I also used JavaScript and created functions to make the webpage more interactive with the list. Once you've completed a task on your list you are able to click on it and it will add a line through stating that is done. If you have a long list of completed tasks you are to click on the "completed tasks" to remove it and focus on unfinished items.


LESSON LEARNED:
In this project I learned how to use CSS more in depth. Such as moving elements specifically where i want them. I learned how Javascript can be used in various ways and how it can be made to make style changes on a website. For example when I click on one of my tasks on the list once it is completed, if i click on it then a line-through will occur. Learning how to execute these style changes with Javascript makes me excited to learn other ways JavaScript can be used.
